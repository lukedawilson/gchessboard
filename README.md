# gchessboard

`gchessboard` is an accessible, customizable and dependency-free chess board web component.

## Getting started

```
TODO: unpkg
```

or

```
npm install gchessboard
```

`gchessboard` is packaged as a [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) and should be usable directly in most modern browsers. It bundles its own (configurable) styles, inline assets (for chess pieces), and code, so using it is as simple as:

```html
<g-chess-board></g-chess-board>
```

## More advanced use cases

```html
<g-chess-board fen="start" interactive></g-chess-board>
```

TODO: add more examples

## Customizing

For details about properties and attributes of the element, events fired, and various CSS properties available for customization, see [API.md](https://github.com/mganjoo/gchessboard/blob/main/API.md).
